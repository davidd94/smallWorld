## Project Vision
This is a complete social network website for terrarium/reptile hobbyist. smallWorld is created to be used by people who love to display their creative setups online. Members can also replicate each other's work through detailed instructions/tutorials, picture gallery, maintenance, item list, and FAQs. In essence, smallWorld is the center where anyone can proudly showcase their passionate hobby.

## Goals
To refine/refactor existing features such as (not limited to) editing tutorial, maintenance and item list section to be a smooth user experience. Private message center backend functionality needs to be revamped to improve security and usability. One of my major goal is to add an interactive photo section in each project. This interactive photo will contain MANY if not ALL of each enclosure/terrarium information (type of materials, brand, notes, plants, fishes, reptiles, etc) that will populate on hover. Lots of front end work is required to achieve smoothness and to have it aesthetically pleasing. To summarize, my goal is striving to provide users the best tools in terms of easiness and user experience. Users should enjoy uploading their work online as much as creating their terrariums/enclosures, frustration-free.

## Technologies/frameworks
<b>Built with</b>
- Python / Flask
- JavaScript / jQuery, ReactJS + Apollo
- Celery / Redis MQ
- GraphQL
- SQLite

<b>NOTE:</b> jQuery was initially used to create the website. Refactoring existing jQuery code to reactJS is in progress. I am not using reactJS in combination with jQuery! I am fully aware it will cause issues if doing so as jQuery directly manipulates the DOM and reactJS works in a virtualDOM.

Other technologies and their versions can be found in the requirements.txt file.
